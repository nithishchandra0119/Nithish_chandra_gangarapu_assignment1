First, I have executed the code in google colab of 4 different types of programs they are:
1)Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping:

    Created a random tensor.
    Found its rank and shape.
    Reshaped and transposed it.
    Broadcasted a smaller tensor and added it.
    Explained TensorFlow's broadcasting.

2)Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning:

    Defined true values and model predictions.
    Computed Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE).
    Modified predictions and checked loss value changes.
    Plotted loss function values.

3)Train a Model with Different Optimizers:

    Loaded the MNIST dataset.
    Trained models with Adam and SGD optimizers.
    Compared accuracy trends.

4)Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard:
   
    Loaded and preprocessed MNIST dataset.
    Trained a neural network and enabled TensorBoard logging.
    Launched TensorBoard to analyze trends.
After the code executed successfully i have created a github new respo, then after created readme file and code fiile.
finally i uploaded the source code (.py file)
